    <h2>Artificial intelligence to serve humanity and the world</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout history, man has searched for an invention that can simulate
      the human mind in its thinking pattern. Artists, writers, filmmakers, and
      game developers alike have tried to find a logical explanation for the
      concept of artificial intelligence. For example, in 1872, “Samuel Butler”
      spoke in his novel “Eriohon” 1872 about machines and the great role they
      will play in developing humanity and moving the world to development and
      prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And over time, artificial intelligence was present only in science
      fiction, sometimes highlighting the potential benefits of artificial
      intelligence on humanity and its bright human aspects, and at other times
      highlighting the negative aspects expected of it, and it is portrayed as
      the fierce enemy of humanity who intends to usurp civilization and control
      it. In 2018, artificial intelligence has become a reality, not a fiction,
      and it no longer occupies a place in the world of popular culture only.
      The year 2018 was a major shift for artificial intelligence, as this
      technology has grown significantly on the ground until it has become a
      major tool that is at the core of all sectors.

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence can also be used to support marginalized groups in
      society, as the Sage Foundation recently partnered with the Seoul City
      Institute for Social Justice in South Africa to launch rAInbow,
      an
      AI-powered program that works to help victims of domestic violence. Where
      domestic violence victims were interviewed to gain a better understanding
      of how to seek help, South Africa was chosen because it tops the list of
      countries with the highest rates of female homicide in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “rAInbow” program works to provide a safe environment for victims of
      domestic violence, as this program helps marginalized groups to know their
      rights and support options available to them, in addition to the places
      where they can receive help in a very easy and smooth way, noting that
      it can be obtained through Facebook Messenger ( Facebook Messenger).
    </p>
    <p>
      In a similar vein, Microsoft announced the launch of a new five-year, $40
      million program called AI for Humanitarian Action, which will harness the
      capabilities of artificial intelligence to help the world recover from
      disasters, meet the needs of children, and the protection of refugees and
      displaced persons, as well as the promotion of the application of human
      rights laws.

    <p>
      While knowing what artificial intelligence is is one thing, understanding
      the basic functions is another. Artificial intelligence works by
      processing data through advanced algorithms. It combs through large
      datasets with its algorithms, learning from patterns or features in the
      data. There are many theories and subfields in artificial intelligence
      systems, including:
    </p>
    <h4>Machine learning</h4>
    <p>
      Machine learning uses neural networks to find hidden insights from data,
      without being programmed as to what to look for or what to infer. Machine
      learning is a popular way for software to find patterns and get smarter
      over time.
    </p>
    <h4>Deep learning</h4>
    <p>
      Deep learning will use huge neural networks with many layers, taking
      advantage of their size to process huge amounts of data with complex
      patterns. Deep learning is a component of machine learning, only with
      larger data sets and more layers.
    </p>

    <h4> Cognitive computing</h4>
    <p>
      Cognitive computing aims at human-like interaction with machines. Think of
      robots that can see and hear, and then respond as a human would.
    </p>
    <h4>Computer vision</h4>
    <p>
      In artificial intelligence, computer vision uses pattern recognition and
      deep learning to make sense of an image or video. This means that the
      device can look around and take pictures or videos in real time,
      interpreting what is around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall goal of artificial intelligence is to make a program that can
      recognize the input, and explain the result with its output. Artificial
      intelligence gives human-like interactions, but it won't replace humans
      any time soon
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages of artificial intelligence</h3>
    <h5>
      -Less room for error
      <br />
      -Make correct decisions
      <br />
      -Apply of artificial intelligence in dangerous situations
      <br />
      -It can work continuously
    </h5>
    <h3>Disadvantages of artificial intelligence</h3>
    <h5>
      -High cost of implementation
      <br />
      -Reliance on machines
      <br />
      <img src="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-artificial-intelligence4.png" width="400" height="220"><img/>
      
      <br/>
      -replace low-skill jobs
      <br />
      -restricted work
    </h5>

    <p>
      In conclusion, today the term artificial intelligence has become one of
      the terms that people circulate a lot, especially with the proliferation
      of smart phones and applications, as artificial intelligence offers many
      tasks that require inputs that people must perform.
      <br />
      And it was replaced by artificial intelligence, which became an automated
      response service and communicated with clients of companies and
      institutions via the Internet, in addition to performing many tasks via
      live broadcast, such as playing chess or any other game, and artificial
      intelligence also contributed to saving the time and effort of the
      research that it was doing. people before, and it became easy and fast.
      <br />
      Artificial intelligence focuses on the processes of exchanging information
      and knowing what is going on in the world to focus information and data
      around it. It has also been used in learning and education processes, in
      addition to performing many tasks and improving its general performance.
      <br />
      Especially since artificial intelligence is used in designing logos,
      processing data and accounts, and responding to customer inquiries. It
      also reduces the need for workers, because artificial intelligence
      combines many skills at the same time. It combines statistics and computer
      skills.
